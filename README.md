## Implementation
### Fractal Computation
The fractal is computed in the complex plane where each pixel $$P$$ is mapped from it's screen coordinates to complex coordinates through an interpolation function $$f_{interpolate}: (P_x, P_y) \mapsto C_x + i\cdot C_y$$ where $$i = \sqrt{-1}$$. Next we iterate a complex number $z$ using the equation $$z_{n+1} = z_{n}^2 + C$$ where $$C = C_x + i\cdot C_y$$ and $$z_0 = 0$$. If at any point during this iteration $$|z_{n}| >= 2$$ then we know that $$\lim_{n \to \infty} z_n = \infty$$ and hence does not belong in the mandelbrot set. Points in the mandelbrot set are colored black while escaped points are colored based on a linear color function assigning values in the range $$[0,  M]$$, where $$M$$ represents the maximum number of iterations we allow before assuming that the point escapes the set.
### Threading Approach
We split up the work by allowing a single thread to compute a single row of pixels in the image. First we create a worker queue and enqueue all row numbers in the image. Next, each thread dequeues a row number and computes the iteration for that single row and updates a global pixel buffer. Once finished it continues to dequeue any remaining rows from the queue ensuring that fast threads always have work.

## Features
- Use the mouse cursor to zoom in and out using left and right mouse button presses
- Use the keyboard to navigate as well. Use the plus/minus keys to zoom in/out and arrow keys to pan an area

## Usage/Examples
Change the iteration formula to see different fractals, currently set to $$z = z^2 + C$$ which renders the Mandelbrot set.

```c
mandelbrot_escape_data get_mandelbrot_iterations(double x, double y,
                                                 int max_iterations) {
  double complex z = 0;
  double complex c = x + y * I;
  for (int i = 0; i < max_iterations; i++) {
    z = z * z + c; //FORMULA
    double dist = cabs(z);
    if (dist >= 2) {
      mandelbrot_escape_data data = {.iterations = i, .distance = dist};
      return data;
    }
  }
  mandelbrot_escape_data data = {.iterations = max_iterations,
                                 .distance = cabs(z)};
  return data; // in set (black)
}

```
